    A software developer with experience in building responsive and scalable web apps. I am well-knowledged in UI/UX principles and practices. I believe that a website is more than just a collection of web pages; it should be a reflection of the brand or individual it represents. I bring a strong foundational understanding of computer science concepts and programming languages to each project I work on. Whether working collaboratively or individually, Iâ€™m committed to taking each task with persistence and striving towards delivering the best possible product.
